# CSES Problem Set Solutions

Welcome to the repository containing solutions to the CSES Problem Set in C++. This repository is dedicated to providing solutions to the introductory problems, sorting and searching, and dynamic programming sections of the CSES Problem Set. The solutions are written in C++ and aim to serve as a helpful resource for anyone looking to understand and implement solutions to these problems.

## Introductory Problems
This section requires basic knowledge of C++ , some high school math including combinatorics and stuff. They are purely logic based with less pre-requisites and are recommended for beginners in competitive programming. Learning C++ STL is a good start.

## Sorting and Searhing
This section is one of the best collection of problems that teaches you many concepts in limited number of problems. Initially, it may look out of your comfort zone, but that is what helps in your progress :)
This section requires the following concepts :
- Sorting
- Binary Search
     - Binary search on a vector
     - Lower and upper bound functions
     - Binary search on answer
     - Min-Max problems
- 2 Pointers
- Greedy Methods
- Data structures like set, multiset, map, heap (priority queue), policy based data structure (ordered set)

## Dynamic Programming 
This is a tough programming technique and the problems on CSES are the best ones for beginners. These problems create a strong foundation to solve tougher DP problems on codeforces and other judges.
